# Parkour - [Relend]

## About
Parkour is a plugin that allows server owners to set up parkours for their players to enjoy, while also letting their players setup their own parkours and climb to the top of the leaderboard!

## Download
Currently, you cannot download the plugin because it is still being heavily developed. Once the plugin is available you will be able to download it from https://spigotmc.org/. You can join my Discord server to be notified about new releases (coming soon).

## Features
- Manage any and all parkours from one cohesive menu
- Setup leaderboards with a click of a button
- Add command rewards for completing different parkours

## Bug Tracker
- None right now :)
